Below are the project specifications.

For this lab, you will create a website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be similar to previous labs. 
You must create your own original work.

Your main goal with this project is to connect to an API using JavaScript, like what we did with Lab 2. 
You should find an open API (e.g. free, but perhaps requires registration), and write a site that uses this API to present the data.

You should look at this list of open APIs (Links to an external site.). 
Avoid APIs that use OAuth for authentication, unless you are already familiar with how to implement this or are an experienced JavaScript programmer. 
Be careful to choose one that has YES listed for CORS. This means you can use purely client-side code to fetch data from the API.
