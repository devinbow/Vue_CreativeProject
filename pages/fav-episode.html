    <h1>The best episode: Gohan Finishes Cell</h1>

      <p>A revived Cell mocks Gohan</p>
    </div>
    <p class="synopsis">The offical name of the episode is "Save The World". The following is a summary via the Dragonball wiki. <br /><br /> Gohan and Cell launch their Kamehamehas at each other as the rest of the Dragon Team pull back. Cell quickly
      gains
      the
      upper hand as the two massive beams collide. Goku tells Gohan to not worry about the Earth as any damage that they cause can be fixed with the Dragon Balls but even then Gohan is unable to gain the advantage.<br /><br />Realizing that Gohan is
      unable to
      push Cell back by himself, Piccolo returns to the battle site and launches a Masenko at Cell, but nothing happens, and instead has Cell spread his wings to direct his aura at Piccolo and knock him out of the air, with Goku sensing this via
      telepathy and Gohan deducing it from Goku's exclamation. The rest of the Z Fighters soon join him, except Vegeta, who stays back believing that their efforts will not make a difference. However, Vegeta notices that the other Z-fighters seem to
      actually causing Cell enough of a distraction for Gohan to push back and realizes it might actually work. As each of the Z-fighters are pushing back against Cell, they each state their own personal motivations for helping Gohan (Piccolo due to
      Gohan teaching him what it meant to have a friend, Krillin to "pay back" Goku and Gohan for having him not keel over, and Tien mostly to redeem himself for simply letting Goku sacrifice himself, especially when beating Goku was pretty much the
      reason he dedicated himself fully to his Crane School training.). <br /><br /> From the Other World, Goku tells Gohan to throw all his remaining ki into the wave, and Gohan gains the advantage for an instant. As they struggle to assist Gohan
      against Cell,
      the Z Fighters soon find themselves at the mercy of Cell's power, and they are all forced to fall back. Just as it looks like Cell will win, Vegeta launches his last Galick Blazer in the entire show at Cell. The blast distracts Cell long enough
      for Gohan to release all of his power into his Kamehameha wave. With Goku saying, "Now's your chance!" to his son, Gohan screams and releases all of his energy at Cell. Cell screams as the Father-Son Kamehameha consumes him. The Energy Wave is
      strong enough to vaporize every cell in his body, preventing any possibility for regeneration. Cell is finally destroyed once and for all, and the Earth is safe again. </p>

    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="thoughts">There are a lot of things to love about this episode. First, Cell has come back after being destroyed. Cell was already an incredible threat before his Zenkai boost, but now he has the ability to teleport while being
      ten times stronger. He is brutal and incredible to watch. Second, Gohan is weakened from a broken arm. It looks like Cell wouldn't be a challenge for a fully powered Gohan, but being nerfed drastically turns the tide. And third,
      Gohan is completely crushed as Goku (his father) sacrificed himself for seemingly nothing. When the beam clash happens, there is
      no hope in Gohan that he will be able to overpower this "perfect weapon". <br /><br />Suddenly, a ki blast shoots out of nowhere, distracting Cell for a fraction of a second. In his mind, Gohan can hear his father's voice shouting
      <strong>"NOW'S YOUR
        CHANCE, DO IT!</strong>" For just a moment, Gohan is able to overpower Cell and destroy every last molecule of his body. The Earth is saved, and Gohan passes out from relief. Throughout the entire beam struggle, we see most of the Z-fighters
      shooting beams at Cell to slow him down. Obviously, as Vegeta was thinking, they couldn't even scratch the monster. But at the pivotal moment, Vegeta overcame his pride and shot a blast with all his energy. Even if it was pointless, even if it
      didn't do anything, he at least had to try. Despite both characters having separate arcs, they both concluded their development at the same time. <br /><br />Gohan finally became the Savior that Goku knew he could be, and Vegeta assisted
      another person with no thought of his own glory or valor. The original creator said that this was meant to be where the series stopped, and it is clear to see. All characters have a satisfying conclusion to their story and the ultimate villan
      is defeated.<br /><br /> My main problem with future arcs of dragon ball is that it takes away from how incredible this moment was, but that will have to come with an update in the future.
