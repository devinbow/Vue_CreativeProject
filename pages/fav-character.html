  <p> Dragonball isn't known for having the best characters. At best, they serve to move the plot forward to a fight. At worst,
    they distract from the themes of the show. Vegeta is the exception. Seemingly in the background until it takes
    center stage in the Majin Buu arc, Vegeta changes from a bloodthirsty tyrant to a man ashamed of his own morality. <br />
    <br /> Here are some of my favorite quotes with a short description why I like them.

    <br />
    <br />
    "You're better than me Kakarot, you are number one!"
    <br />
    The absolute culimation of Vegeta's character development. Moving past his pride, and accepting that his rival is stronger at the end of the series.

    <br />
    <br />
    "You may have invaded my mind and my body, but there's one thing a Saiyan always keeps. HIS PRIDE!"
    <br />
    After being taken over via mind control, Vegeta regains his senses. The delivery of the line is 10/10.
    <br />
    <br />
    "Trunks, Bulma... I do this for you. And yes, even for you Kakarot."
    <br />
    Vegeta sacrifices himself to save the world. For the first time, as piccolo said, he was fighting for someone other than himself.
    <br />
    <br />

    "LET ME ASK YOU, DOES A MACHINE LIKE YOURSELF EVER EXPERIENCE FEAR?"
    <br />
    One of Vegeta's biggest moments. After transforming as a super saiyan on screen for the first time, he absolutely dominates a seemingly unbeatable opponent with an incredible finisher.

    <br />
    <br />
    "I swear on my pride, I'll buy you one minute!"
    <br />
    Against a foe much stronger than himself, Vegeta promises to give Goku a minute to charge up.
    <br />
